## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Augusto Duart Fontana, and I'm from Brazil. I've been working in software development since 2006. I love coding and developing software, it's something that comes naturally to me, and I enjoy doing it.

Always pushing for the best quality in every line of code. Clean code for life!
